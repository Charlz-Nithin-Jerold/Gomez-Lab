Our lab consists of researchers focused on understanding the genetic drivers of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, as well as multiple myeloma. We explore how somatic mutations shape disease characteristics and influence treatment responses.

Key Research Areas:

	•	Genomics of Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphomas and multiple myeloma.
	•	Somatic variation in diverse human populations.
	•	Deep sequencing of Hodgkin Lymphoma genomes, linking genetic variation with survival and disease progression.

Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), responsible for 10% of all lymphomas in the Western world, remains challenging due to relapse and treatment resistance in some patients. The rarity of malignant Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in cHL complicates the detection of somatic mutations, demanding advanced sequencing and analysis techniques.

We address these challenges by:

	•	Utilizing ultra-deep exome-wide sequencing paired with customized filtering and analysis strategies to detect somatic mutations in cHL.
	•	Investigating the association between low variant allele frequency (VAF) mutations in HRS cells and clinical outcomes.

Our mission is to advance oncology by integrating genome profiling with cutting-edge laboratory and bioinformatics techniques, driving research that impacts clinical practices and improves patient care.
